This is where the proposal should be outlined.

## Overview
<!--
At a high-level address what your proposal is and how it will address the problem identified. Highlight any benefits to the R Community that follow from solving the problem. This should be your most compelling section.

Project member Aaron Jacobs wrote a demo-quality external sampling profiler for R
earlier this year, which is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/atheriel/rtrace).

This demo (1) proves that this is indeed possible for R; and (2) points the way
to the technologies that are needed to make it work.

We propose to turn this demo-quality project into a robust set of tools that can
be used by the wider community.

## Detail
<!--
Go into more detail about the specifics of the project and it delivers against the problem.

Depending on project type the detail section should include:

 - [ ] Minimum Viable Product
 - [ ] Architecture
 - [ ] Assumptions

In order to make this tool more widely useful, we propose to break in into two
components: a command-line tool for users and a C library that backs this
program and other interfaces. This will involve:

* Refactoring the existing code to be more robust, handle more diverse R
  environments, and report errors to the caller; and

* Be sufficiently portable to work on any Linux distribution and any
  sufficiently recent version of R.

It is our view that a tool for R users is unlikely to be successful if it does
not have an R-level interface. To that end, the second major goal of this
project would be to create an R package backed by the same library. Provided
that this library is relatively portable and written in C, we believe that such
a package would be admissible to CRAN.

The delivery of a C library, command-line program, and R package that work under
Linux is the minimum viable product (MVP) of this proposal.

In addition to this MVP, we propose to "port" the tool so that it works in two
other common R environments:

* Under Windows. Although there are likely fewer "production" deployments of R
  on Windows, it is a major platform for R users. The
  [rbspy](https://rbspy.github.io/) profiler for Ruby has shown that it is
  possible to support Windows in this way; we feel we could learn from them and
  make the same approach work for this project.

* Under Docker. Although Docker is, of course, Linux, its use of process
  namespaces render the existing demo nonfunctional, and Dockerized R is very
  likely the medium-term future of production in R. The
  [Pyflame](https://github.com/uber/pyflame) profiler for Python has shown that
  it is possible to circumvent the namespace issues; we feel we could make the
  same approach work for this project.

## Alternatives

A new, external sampling profiler is not the only way to achieve live, opt-in
profiling of running R programs. It would also be possible to modify R itself to
switch on profiling in response to some kind of IPC, such as a Unix signal.

However, there are major drawbacks to such an undertaking: it would require
modifying R itself, perhaps in ways that have an undesirable impact on its
complexity or performance, and would only allow code running under new versions
of R (perhaps quite some time from now) to be profiled in this way. As a result,
we believe a new tool is a better way to accomplish the project's goals.

# Project plan

## Start-up phase
<!--
Covering the planning phase, this section should provide a relatively detailed plan of how work will start on the project. This section is important because projects need to get up and running quickly.


 - [ ] Setting up collaboration platform inc. code for contributors etc.
 - [ ] Licence decisions
 - [ ] Reporting framework
-->


## Technical delivery
<!--
Covering the actual delivery of the project this section should provide at least a high-level the implementation. 

Including target dates is really important as you need to be committed and the ISC need to have a means of tracking delivery
-->

The timeline of the project is intended to be short:

* Within one month. Delivery of the proposed MVP: refactoring of the demo into a
  portable C program and library for Linux, plus an R package interface.

* Within the second month. Delivery of the proposed ports to Windows and Docker,
  plus a substantive blog post for the project and submission of the R package
  to CRAN.

Given the plan to work nearly full-time on this proposal, we believe this should
be possible.

## Other aspects
<!--
Covering non-technical activities like on-going publicity, paper preparation, discussion groups etc. that might be required to facilitate successful delivery of the project.

 - [ ] Announcement post
 - [ ] Delivery blog post
 - [ ] Twitter
 - [ ] UseR!
 - [ ] ISC meetings
-->

In order to publicise the project and ensure that R users can actively benefit
from it, we propose writing a blog post, ideally for the R Consortium,
explaining how to use the tools provided by the project.

Since the goals of the project are relatively narrow and use cases are fairly
narrow, we believe a single tutorial/evangelist-style post will be the most
appropriate reference point for the community.

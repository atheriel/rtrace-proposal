# Requirements
<!-- 
An idea of what is required to make the project actually happen
-->

Since the deliverables of this proposal are all code, the requirements of this
project are the funding required to cover development costs.

No special tools, tech, or equipment beyond the existing resources of project
members will be required.

<!-- ## People -->
<!--
Who needs to be involved, what's the proposed structure, what will it take to get their involvement?
-->

<!-- ## Processes -->
<!-- 
What processes need to be put in place e.g. codes of conduct, regular ISC meetings, handover to the community at large?
-->

<!-- ## Tools & Tech -->
<!--
What is going to be needed to deliver this project? 

Will cloud computing be used - if yes are there are necessary components that will be deciding factors between providers?

Are there tools or tech that don't exist that will be produced to facilitate the project?
-->

## Funding
<!-- 
[TO DO] THE GUIDANCE IS PRETTY UNCLEAR, ESP IN LIGHT OF GABOR'S PROPOSAL VS AWARD SIZE

-->

We request a total of $8,500 to support the equivalent of 1.5 months salary for
project member Aaron Jacobs. He has arranged with his employer to spend up to 80
percent of his time over the course of eight weeks on unpaid leave to work on
this project, should it receive funding. His employer will continue to permit
access to existing compute resources to him during this time.

The award size in this case is similar to those of the successful
[sftraj](https://github.com/mablab/sftraj-proposal) and [Licensing
R](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/isc-proposal-licence) proposals, namely that
it essentially covers the cost of salary, and over a similar period.

# Success
<!-- 
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery 
-->

## Definition of done
<!-- 
What does success look like? 
-->

## Measuring success
<!-- 
How will we know when success is achieved, what markers can we use along the way 
-->

## Future work
<!-- 
How could this be extended / developed in the future by yourself and/or the community in general?
-->

Our suggested future work would include

* Packaging of the command-line tool for various Linux distributions, first and
  foremost the Debian project (and downstream distributions, including Ubuntu).
  This would improve the ease with which this tool would be available in these
  environments.

* Support for macOS. Although it is unlikely that many users are running
  production workloads on macOS, it is a popular distribution for R developers.

* Support for mixed-mode sampling of C/C++ and R stacks, as originally
  envisioned by the [Jointprof project](https://r-prof.github.io/jointprof/).

## Key risks
